## Inspiration 
[Automate the Boring Stuff Book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) 
* The topic about os & file handling inspired me to automate the fussy job of sorting a myraid of files which can be time consuming. Why not run it in the background and let the script sort it out for you? :grin:
